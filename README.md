This project is the idea of making of pill detection system, by which we will be able to exaclty tell what is the name , color, shape and size of the pill.
The ocr.py file will be used for getting prescription and telling the name of the medicines.
Data.py is a extensive program in which name of serveral medicines as well as their dosage and price has been listed.
Main.py is a program which will be used to detect the medicine by switching on the camera and the reading the text if written on the medicine.
color.py will be helping to tell the  color of the medicine and trying to match it to the medicine from data.py program.
